# 3D-model of an old hotel, a Blender project

This was a small hoppy project of mine. I like weird and creepy looking buildings and after encountering a picture of this
nice old hotel https://thesocietyhotel.com/ decided to make a model of it. Well, its not that creepy anymore since its been renovated. The making of the thing (me modelling, not the actual construction on this ugly beauty in the times of past) was lots of little tweaks here and there. The initial layout of things was achieved by matching a picture of the hotel to values of Blender camera. I used this excellend add-on https://github.com/mrossini-ethz/camera-calibration-pvr for camera calibration. Okay, with this method its probably never going to be a perfect match, but I think I managed to capture the overall feeling of the building. Something is missing still: the hotel looks a bit too clean and empty. With the bumb maps it doesnt look like a lego house anymore, but it certainly needs something. Maybe I will use it in a future project as part of a scene. I could create a night scene with creepy looking old shops for example.
