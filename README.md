# 3D-model of an old hotel, a Blender project

This was a small hobby project of mine. I like weird and creepy looking buildings and after encountering a picture of this
nice old hotel https://thesocietyhotel.com/ decided to make a model of it. Well, its not that creepy anymore since its been renovated. The making of the thing (me modelling, not the actual construction on this ugly beauty in the times of the past) was lots of little tweaks here and there. The initial layout of things was achieved by matching a picture of the hotel to values of Blender camera. I used this excellent add-on https://github.com/mrossini-ethz/camera-calibration-pvr for camera calibration. Okay, with this method its probably never going to be a perfect match, but I think I managed to capture the overall feeling of the building. 

At this point it's in a state of "somewhat ready and waiting use in some scene". Depending on where I'm going to use it it might still look too clean. It has some decent bumb maps now so it doesn't look like a lego house (look at the next picture and see what I mean..), but it certainly needs more dirt and more bumb and/or normal maps for the store front. We'll see what will happen! Maybe I will use it in a future project as part of a scene. I could create a night scene with creepy looking old shops for example.
